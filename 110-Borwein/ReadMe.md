    In 2001, the Borwein brothers studied the following integrals, which now bear their name:

$$ ∀n ∈ N, I_{n} = \int_{0}^{+∞} \prod_{k=0}^{n} {\frac {\sin( \frac {x} {2K+1} )} {\frac {x} {2K+1}}} dx $$

    These integrals are remarkable because the first ones are all equal to π/2.<br>
    An obvious conjecture would be that this is true for every value of n.<br>
    Some decades ago, an old-school mathemacian would have had to hand-calculate<br>
    the values of the first integrals (which would take several months, or even years),<br>
    the nassume all the integrals are equal to π, and finally try and demonstrate this conjecture.<br>
    <br>
    Today, we can use numerical calculus to evaluate as many of these integrals as possible before getting into a demonstration.<br>
    This is the goal of this project.<br>
    We'we had to compute Borwein integrals, using the midpoint rule, the trapezoidal rule and the Simpson’s rule,<br>
    and print both the value of In and the absolute difference between In and π.<br>
