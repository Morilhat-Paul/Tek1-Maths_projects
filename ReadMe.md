| Name | Description | Percentages |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [101-Pong](https://github.com/Morilhat-Paul/Tek1-Maths_projects/blob/main/101-Pong) | Using vectors, calculate the position of a ball in three-dimensional space and the angle at which it bounces off a wall at (0;0) | 100% |
| [104-Intersection](https://github.com/Morilhat-Paul/Tek1-Maths_projects/blob/main/104-Intersection) | Calculate the points of intersection between light rays and objects (spheres, cylinders, cones) by solving quadratic equations formed by the 3D surface equations and the light ray equations | 87% |
| [108-Trigo](https://github.com/Morilhat-Paul/Tek1-Maths_projects/blob/main/108-Trigo) | Apply a given function (such as cosine, exponentiation, hyperbolic tangent) to a matrix and print out the resulting value | 72% |
| [110-Borwein](https://github.com/Morilhat-Paul/Tek1-Maths_projects/blob/main/110-Borwein) | Use numerical methods (midpoint rule, trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule) to calculate these integrals and print both the value of In and the absolute difference between In and Ï€/2 | 100% |
