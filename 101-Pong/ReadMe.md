  101-Pong
  <br>
</h1>

&nbsp;

<h3 align="center">
    Pong, an arcade game developped in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game.<br>
    It was inspired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on an oscilloscope.<br>
    The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the Breakout game ...).<br>
    Only one paddle will be considered, located in the (Oxy) plane (which is defined by the equation z = 0).<br>
